# VaultTrack

**A secure Stacks blockchain tool for managing digital assets with robust tracking and access control**

## Project Overview

VaultTrack is a Clarity smart contract project that provides a secure and efficient way to manage digital assets on the Stacks blockchain. The main features of the project include:

- Robust tracking and access control for digital assets
- Secure storage and management of digital assets
- Flexible permissions and authorization model
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality and security

The VaultTrack contract serves as the core component of the project, handling the storage, tracking, and access control of digital assets.

## Contract Architecture

The VaultTrack contract is designed with the following key components:

### Data Structures

- `asset-vault`: A mapping that stores the digital assets, keyed by the asset ID.
- `asset-owners`: A mapping that tracks the owners of each digital asset.
- `access-control`: A mapping that manages the permissions and access control for each asset.

### Public Functions

- `create-asset`: Allows authorized users to create a new digital asset and store it in the vault.
- `transfer-asset`: Enables the transfer of a digital asset from one owner to another.
- `grant-access`: Grants access permissions for a specific asset to a given principal.
- `revoke-access`: Revokes access permissions for a specific asset from a given principal.

The contract uses a combination of state variables, mappings, and authorization checks to ensure the secure management of digital assets.

## Installation & Setup

To set up the VaultTrack project, follow these steps:

1. Install Clarinet, the Clarity smart contract development tool.
2. Clone the VaultTrack repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:
   ```
   clarinet check
   clarinet build
   clarinet test
   ```

This will ensure that the project dependencies are installed, the contracts are compiled, and the test suite is executed successfully.

## Usage Guide

Here are some examples of how to interact with the VaultTrack contract:

### Creating a New Asset

```clarity
(create-asset
  "MyAsset"
  "This is a description of my digital asset."
  <asset-owner-principal>)
```

This will create a new digital asset with the given name and description, and assign the specified principal as the owner.

### Transferring an Asset

```clarity
(transfer-asset
  <asset-id>
  <new-owner-principal>)
```

This will transfer the ownership of the specified digital asset to the new owner principal.

### Granting Access

```clarity
(grant-access
  <asset-id>
  <granted-principal>
  (list access-read access-write))
```

This will grant the specified principal read and write access permissions for the given digital asset.

### Revoking Access

```clarity
(revoke-access
  <asset-id>
  <revoked-principal>)
```

This will revoke all access permissions for the specified principal on the given digital asset.

For more detailed examples and information, please refer to the comprehensive test suite in the /workspace/tests/vault-track_test.ts file.

## Testing

The VaultTrack project includes a comprehensive test suite located in the /workspace/tests/vault-track_test.ts file. This test suite covers a wide range of scenarios, including:

- Successful creation, transfer, and access control of digital assets
- Error handling for invalid inputs or unauthorized actions
- Edge cases and corner cases to ensure the contract's robustness

To run the tests, use the following Clarinet command:

```
clarinet test
```

The test suite ensures that the VaultTrack contract functions as expected and provides a high level of confidence in the project's security and reliability.

## Security Considerations

The VaultTrack contract incorporates several security measures to protect the digital assets and ensure the integrity of the system:

1. **Authorization and Access Control**: The contract uses a permissions-based model to manage access to digital assets. Only authorized principals can perform actions like creating, transferring, or granting access to assets.

2. **Input Validation**: The contract performs thorough input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like integer underflow/overflow, unintended state changes, and other potential exploits.

3. **Error Handling**: The contract includes robust error handling to ensure that invalid or unexpected inputs are properly handled and do not lead to unintended consequences.

4. **Testing**: The comprehensive test suite helps identify and address any security vulnerabilities or edge cases in the contract's implementation.

By adhering to best practices and incorporating these security measures, the VaultTrack contract aims to provide a secure and reliable platform for managing digital assets on the Stacks blockchain.
